## Data Viz on Web Interfaces: Choosing a Open-Source Charting (Graphing) Libraries
If you know or plan to learn programmatic languages, you might be wondering how to pick a charting library. Charting  are built by data visualization experts who want to make the visualization process easier and empower the data storytelling of more people -- developers, analysts, data scientists, or scholars. 

It is helpful to note that data visualization on web interfaces initially started in **front-end languages** like JavaScript. The charting libraries for JavaScript allow a higher level of customization in interactions, but that also means they are more complicated in syntax (i.e. more lines of code in creating the same graph) than Python-based graphing libraries.

Below is an overview of the commonly used charting libraries outlining the languages they are available in as well as their pros and cons.

### Visualize fo Scientific Reporting

These libraries lie on a spectrum of visualization purposes. The leftmost end represents the purpose to **visualize for scientific reporting**, which produces graphs that are more informational than interactive and mostly static.

### Visualize fo Creative Storytelling

On the other hand, the rightmost end represents the purpose to do **creative data storytelling**, which allows a high level of customization of a graph. Going right on the spectrum increases the level of customization in graphs and more complex syntax. For example, a graphing libary like Plotly allows a certain level of customization (e.g. colors, bar widths) and interactivity, but its graph types are strictly set to a certain graphic convention. Whereas in D3.js, you could experiment with different ways to draw a graph.
