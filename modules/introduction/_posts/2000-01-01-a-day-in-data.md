## What is "Big Data" and how is it valuable?
Regardless which field you come from, you might have heard of the term "big data" at some point. 

**Big data** is characterized by the 4 V's:
- Volume (size of data)
- Velocity (speed in which it is generated and collected)
- Variety (structured, semi-structured, unstructured)

You might be wondering, what does this data tell us? In fact, big data analytics is extremely valuable across different fields, but how so?
